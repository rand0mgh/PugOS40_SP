# PugOS40_SP
The POS40 Skin Pack (now archived, it is not recommended to use this one.)
This is a archived version of the PugOS 40 skin pack.
It is no longer reccomended to use this, but you can download the PugOS 10X virtual machine image [here.](https://www.mediafire.com/file/sv2s3uzqr3bfn3z/PugOS+10X.ova/file)  
All this essentially just does is installs `xubuntu-desktop, lxpanel (replaces xfce4-panel), cairo-dock, cairo-dock-plug-ins` and the Fluent GTK theme.
